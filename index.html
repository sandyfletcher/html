                            <li>Add remaining sugar, salt, oil and 3 cups of flour, mixing to combine.</li>
                            <li>Add another cup of flour and mix to combine, continuing to add more, ½ cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                            <li>The dough should be smooth and elastic and slightly stick to a clean finger, but not be overly sticky. Add a little more flour if needed.</li>
                            <li>Mix the dough for 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface.</li>

                            <li>Cover with a dish towel or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 ½ hours.</li>
                            <li>Oil two 9x5" bread pans generously and add a small piece of parchment paper at the bottom if the pan sticks.</li>
                            <li>Punch the dough down well to remove air bubbles, shape into two long logs and place into prepared loaf pans.</li>
                            <li>Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise again until an inch above the top of the pan, about 45 minutes.</li>

                            <li>Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden brown on top - should sound hollow when tapped.</li>
                            <li>Invert loaves onto wire cooling rack and brush tops with butter.</li>
                            <li>Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing, then store in an airtight container.</li>

                        <p>Author: Nagi | Prep: 5 minutes | Cook: 40 minutes | Rising: 2 hours | Servings: 10-12 slices (Rated 4.96 from 1557 votes)</p>
                        <p>This super crusty homemade bread recipe is going to blow your mind! The world’s easiest yeast bread that’s just like the very best artisan bread you pay top dollar for, with an incredible crispy, chewy crust, and big fat holes like sourdough. Recipe is forgiving so don’t fret if things don’t go perfectly, it will be salvageable.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 cups (450g) flour, bread or plain/all purpose (Note 1)</li>
                            <li>2 tsp instant or rapid rise yeast (Note 2 for normal / active dry yeast)</li>
                            <li>2 tsp cooking / kosher salt, NOT table salt (Note 3)</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) very warm tap water, NOT boiling or super hot (ie up to 55°C/130°F) (Note 4)</li>
                            <li><strong>Dough shaping:</strong></li>
                            <li>1 1/2 tbsp flour, for dusting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Mix Dough:</strong> Mix flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl. Add water, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable, but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency (see video at 17 sec, Note 5).</li>
                            <li><strong>Rise:</strong> Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 – 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer (Note 6).</li>
                            <li><strong>Optional – refrigerate for flavour development (Note 9):</strong> At this stage, you can either bake immediately (move onto Step 5) or refrigerate for up to 3 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Take chill out of refrigerated dough</strong> – if you refrigerated dough per above, leave the bowl on the counter for 45 – 60 minutes while the oven is preheating. Cold dough does not rise as well.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preheat oven (Note 7)</strong> – Put dutch oven in oven with lid on (26cm/10" or larger). Preheat to 230°C/450°F (220° fan) 30 minutes prior to baking. (Note 8 for no dutch oven)</li>
                            <li><strong>Shape dough:</strong> Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour.</li>
                            <li>Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transfer to paper:</strong> Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!</li>
                            <li><strong>Dough in pot:</strong> Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot, place lid on.</li>
                            <li>Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy.</li>
                            <li>Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Cook uncovered, stirring often, until thickened (2-3 min). Remove pot from heat and stir in black pepper and ½ tsp lime juice. Add salt, pepper, or lime juice to taste. Cover until ready to serve.</li>
                            <li><strong>Salsa:</strong> Combine 15 oz tomatoes, ½ medium chopped onion, chopped chiles/jalapeno, 1 chopped garlic clove + 1 smashed garlic clove, ½ tsp hot sauce, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp chipotle chili powder, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
                            <li>Heat 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil in a medium skillet over low heat.</li>

                            <li>Coat one side of warmed tortillas with a layer of the prepared refried beans.</li>
                            <li>Heat and heavily butter a saucepan smaller than your tortillas.</li>

                            <li>Once egg is mostly formed, place a tortilla bean-side-down over the egg mixture. Press gently. Flip the tortilla so the egg is now on top, inside the tortilla.</li>
                            <li>Add desired toppings (salsa, cheese) onto the egg. Fold tortilla sides up to create a wrap.</li>
                            <li>Carefully flip the wrap seam-side down in the pan to help seal.</li>
                            <li>Cook for a few minutes, turning as needed, to brown the tortilla and warm contents.</li>
                            <li>Transfer to a cutting board and halve. Serve alongside avocado slices and pico de gallo.</li>

                        <p>Serves 4 to 6.</p>
                        <p>You couldn't pack more health-inducing goodness into this chicken soup if you tried. It's teeming with all of the restorative properties of ginger and turmeric and thickened with white rice, which swells as it cooks and turns a watery broth into a hearty, comforting porridge. This is exactly what you need when what you need is to get well. Rice acts as a thickening agent when cooked this way, thanks to its naturally occurring starch, so be sure to simmer the soup until the grains of rice are no longer distinct from the broth they cook in—and the whole thing turns rich and cozy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>10 scallions</li>
                            <li>10 garlic cloves</li>
                            <li>1 (4-inch) piece fresh ginger</li>
                            <li>2 limes</li>
                            <li>1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 4 thighs)</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon Kosher salt (plus more to taste)</li>
                            <li>3/4 cup jasmine or basmati rice</li>
                            <li>9 cups water</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (plus more for garnish)</li>
                            <li>Cilantro leaves and tender stems (for garnish)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Do some prep:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Thinly slice 10 scallions crosswise, setting aside about ½ cup of the dark green parts for serving.</li>
                                    <li>Lightly smash and peel 10 garlic cloves.</li>
                                    <li>Thinly slice 1 (4-inch) piece of ginger lengthwise into planks. No need to peel it! Just give it a scrub with some water if it looks dirty.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Start the soup:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the scallions (white and light green parts), garlic, ginger, and 1 1/4 teaspoons turmeric. Cook, stirring often, until the aromatics are softened and fragrant but not browned, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>Add 1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, 1 tablespoon salt, 9 cups water, and 3/4 cup jasmine rice to the pot. (Note: In most cases, it's best to first rinse the rice to remove any excess starch that would cause the rice to stick together as it cooks, but since we're aiming for thickened porridge, there's no need to rinse it.) Bring the water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pot if the rice is sticking and reducing the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer, until the rice breaks down and thickens the soup to a porridge-like consistency, 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Shred the chicken:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Using tongs, pluck out the chicken and transfer it to a plate to cool.</li>
                                    <li>While the chicken cools, use a wooden spoon to fish around for the garlic cloves, which at this point will be very, very soft. Use the back of the spoon to smash the garlic against the inside walls of the pot to crush and incorporate it into the soup. If you feel like it, you can pluck out and discard the sliced ginger at this point as well—it’s a little tough to eat, but I usually just eat around it.</li>
                                    <li>Once the chicken has cooled, remove and discard the skin. Use two forks to shred the meat from the bones. Discard the bones. Return the shredded meat to the pot and give it a stir.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Season the soup and serve:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Squeeze the juice of 2 limes into the soup.</li>
                                    <li>Stir in 1 teaspoon black pepper. Taste the soup and add more salt if you think it needs it.</li>
                                    <li>Divide the soup among soup bowls. Garnish it with the reserved sliced scallion greens, some cilantro leaves, a good crank of black pepper, and an additional drizzle of olive oil.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>If you've never dipped your spoon into the vast world of grain-thickened porridges, don't stop here. There are many versions, both sweet and savory, that span the globe, from rice-based Asian congee and its many variants throughout the continent to Italian polenta, Jamaican hominy porridge, and hot cereal faves like oatmeal. Though each is distinct, what they collectively share is an ability to comfort and soothe.</p>

                            <li><strong>Sauté:</strong> In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, sea salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Cook for 5–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Add squash:</strong> Stir in cubed butternut squash and cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften and lightly caramelize.</li>
                            <li><strong>Add aromatics:</strong> Add chopped garlic, sage, rosemary, and grated ginger. Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute more, until fragrant.</li>

                            <li>Place the eggplant in a colander and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt. Place in the sink or over a large rimmed plate and set aside for 20 minutes to drain. Blot dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
                            <li>Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Add another 1 tablespoon olive oil and the zucchini to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender but not mushy. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and transfer to the bowl with the eggplant.</li>

                            <li>Soak cabbage pieces in cold water, then drain and place into a large basin. Sprinkle with 1 cup kosher salt, tossing to distribute.</li>
                            <li>Turn cabbage every 30 minutes for a total of 1½ hours to ensure even salting.</li>
                            <li>Rinse the cabbage thoroughly in cold water 3 times to remove excess salt. Drain well and set aside.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Porridge:</strong> In a pot, combine 3 cups water and ½ cup sweet rice flour. Mix well and bring to a boil, stirring constantly.

                            <li><strong>Make Kimchi Paste:</strong> Place the cooled porridge into a very large mixing bowl. Add fish sauce, hot pepper flakes (gochugaru), crushed garlic, minced ginger, and minced onion. If using, add chopped salty fermented squid. Mix well.</li>
                            <li>Add chopped leek, diagonally sliced green onions, julienned carrot, and julienned Korean radish to the paste. Mix all ingredients thoroughly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Add the drained, salted cabbage to the kimchi paste in the large basin. Mix by hand (preferably wearing gloves) until the cabbage is evenly coated with the paste. If your basin isn't large enough, do this in batches.</li>
                            <li><strong>Store & Ferment:</strong> Transfer the kimchi to an airtight container or glass jars, pressing down to remove air pockets.</li>
                            <li>You can eat it fresh immediately, or allow it to ferment. For fermentation, you can leave it at room temperature for 1-2 days (taste daily) until it reaches your desired sourness, then refrigerate to slow down fermentation. Alternatively, refrigerate immediately for slower fermentation.</li>

                            <li>8 cherry tomatoes or small cocktail tomatoes, halved or quartered</li>
                            <li>1 head Boston lettuce, leaves separated</li>
                            <li>6 radishes, trimmed and quartered</li>
                            <li>2 5 1/2-ounce cans Italian or Spanish tuna packed in olive oil, drained</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup nicoise olives</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Put the potatoes in a medium saucepan; cover with cold water and season with salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook until fork-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl; drizzle with the wine and let cool. Reserve the saucepan.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, bring a separate saucepan of salted water to a boil. Fill a bowl with salted ice water. Add the haricots verts to the boiling water; cook until crisp-tender and bright green, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and immediately plunge into the ice water to cool; drain and pat dry.</li>
                            <li>Place the eggs in the reserved saucepan and cover with cold water by about 1 inch. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then cover, remove from the heat and let stand, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, then run under cold water to cool. Peel under cold running water.</li>
                            <li>Make the dressing: Whisk the vinegar, shallot, mustard, thyme, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste in a bowl. Whisk in the olive oil in a slow, steady stream until emulsified.</li>
                            <li>Toss the tomatoes in a small bowl with salt and pepper to taste. Add about 1/4 cup dressing to the potatoes and toss. Quarter the hard-cooked eggs.</li>
                            <li>Divide the lettuce among 4 plates. Arrange the potatoes, haricots verts, radishes, hard-cooked eggs and tuna on top. Pour any juices from the tomatoes into the dressing, then add the tomatoes to the plates. Drizzle with the dressing and top with the olives.</li>

                            <li>1 tsp lemon zest</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>

                            <li>Optional: Brie cheese, cubed (amount to taste)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Whisk heavy cream, egg yolks, parmesan cheese, and lemon zest in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettucine and cook according to package directions until al dente.</li>
                            <li>Before draining, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot (off heat).</li>
                            <li>Immediately pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta. Toss or stir quickly and continuously to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and melt the cheese. Add a splash of the reserved pasta water at a time, as needed, to create a smooth, creamy sauce that coats the pasta.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the lemon juice. If using Brie, add it now and stir until melted and incorporated.</li>
                            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed.</li>
                            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated parmesan cheese.</li>

                            <li><strong>Marinara Sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, reduce heat to low.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until sauce has thickened. Discard basil sprigs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Preheat broiler. Set a wire rack on a baking sheet.</li>
                            <li>Prepare dredging stations:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>In a shallow dish: flour.</li>
                                    <li>In another shallow dish: whisk eggs with 1 tbsp water.</li>
                                    <li>In a third shallow dish: combine panko bread crumbs, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 cup grated Parmesan.</li>
                                    <li>In a separate bowl: combine shredded mozzarella and the remaining 1 cup grated Parmesan for topping.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>If chicken cutlets are uneven, pound them to an even 1/4" thickness. Pat chicken dry and season with Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides.</li>
                            <li>Dip each chicken cutlet first into flour (shaking off excess), then into the egg mixture (letting excess drip off), and finally into the panko-Parmesan mixture, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
                            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, heat vegetable or canola oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F or shimmers. (About 1/2 inch of oil).</li>
                            <li>Working in batches, fry chicken for 1-2 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
                            <li>Transfer cooked chicken to the prepared wire rack. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
                            <li>Spoon a generous amount of marinara sauce over each chicken cutlet. Sprinkle with the mozzarella-Parmesan cheese mixture.</li>
                            <li>Broil until cheese is melted, bubbly, and has some golden brown spots, about 2-3 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.</li>
                            <li>Top with chopped fresh basil and serve immediately, with extra marinara sauce on the side if desired.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
                            <li>In a saucepan, combine cubed chicken, sliced carrots, frozen peas, and sliced celery. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>While chicken and vegetables are cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>

                            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the sauce has thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                            <li>Place one unbaked pie crust in the bottom of a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
                            <li>Add the cooked chicken and vegetable mixture to the bottom pie crust. Pour the hot broth mixture over the chicken and vegetables.</li>
                            <li>Cover with the top crust. Seal the edges by crimping them together. Cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, about 30-35 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>

                            <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown chicken pieces in hot vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
                            <li>To the same skillet, add condensed soup, water, and crushed basil leaves. Stir well and bring to a boil.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness (approx. 1/2 - 3/4 inch)</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp melted butter or olive oil</li>
                            <li>1 tsp kosher salt (for seasoning)</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
                            <li><strong>For Brine (Optional):</strong></li>
                            <li>1 litre (4 cups) warm water</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup kosher salt</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Brine (Optional but Recommended):</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve 1/4 cup kosher salt in 1 litre of warm water. Add the chicken breasts and let them brine for 15-30 minutes at room temperature. (Alternatively, cover and refrigerate for up to 6 hours). Remove chicken breasts from brine, rinse thoroughly with cold water to remove excess salt, then pat them completely dry with paper towels.</li>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F (232°C).</li>
                            <li>Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a baking dish or on a baking sheet. Brush both sides of the chicken with melted butter or olive oil.</li>
                            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tsp kosher salt (use less if you brined for a long time), black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Sprinkle this seasoning mixture evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) at the thickest part. Cooking time will vary depending on breast thickness.</li>
                            <li>For a more golden top, you can turn the broiler on high for the final 2-3 minutes of cooking. Watch carefully to prevent burning.</li>
                            <li>Remove the pan from the oven. Transfer the chicken to a clean cutting board or plate, tent loosely with foil, and let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing or serving. This helps keep the chicken juicy.</li>

                            <li>1 ¼ cup shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, pepper jack, cheddar, or a mix), divided</li>
                            <li><strong>For Serving (Optional Toppings):</strong></li>
                            <li>Sliced avocado</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Make Cheese Sauce:</strong> Melt 2 tbsp butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in 2 tbsp flour and ¼ tsp salt until a paste forms. Cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in 1 cup whole milk. Cook and stir until the sauce thickens and bubbles, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 ¾ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly coat a 9×13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Peppers:</strong> Slice the bell peppers in half lengthwise from top to bottom. Remove the seeds and membranes. Arrange the pepper halves cut side up in the prepared baking dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Filling:</strong> Heat 2 tsp olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground chicken (or turkey), chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, ½ tsp kosher salt, and ¼ tsp black pepper. Cook, breaking apart the meat with a spoon, until the chicken is browned and cooked through, about 4-6 minutes. Drain off any excess liquid.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes with their juices. Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the cooked rice (or quinoa/cauliflower rice) and ¾ cup of the shredded Monterey Jack (or similar) cheese.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stuff Peppers:</strong> Mound the filling evenly inside each bell pepper half. Top with the remaining ½ cup shredded cheese.</li>
                            <li>Pour a small amount of water (about ¼ to ½ cup) into the bottom of the baking dish, around the peppers (not into them). This helps them steam and soften.</li>
                            <li>Bake uncovered for 25 to 35 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                            <li>Serve hot, topped with the prepared cheese sauce and any of your favorite optional toppings.</li>

                            <li><strong>Prepare for Frying:</strong> Heat oil in a deep pan or Dutch oven to 350°F (175°C). Ensure there's enough oil to at least halfway submerge the shrimp, about 1-2 inches deep.</li>
                            <li>Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels. Place cornstarch in a shallow dish or bowl. Coat the shrimp thoroughly in cornstarch, shaking off any excess.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fry Shrimp:</strong> Working in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pan (which lowers oil temperature), carefully add the coated shrimp to the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Shrimp cook quickly.</li>
                            <li>Remove fried shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate.</li>

                            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Sauce:</strong> In a small saucepan, combine Frank's Red Hot sauce, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ¼ tsp salt, red pepper flakes (if using), minced garlic, and onion powder.</li>
                            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat and let the sauce rest and cool slightly for about 5 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Salmon:</strong> Line a baking sheet with foil or parchment paper. Place salmon fillet(s) on the prepared baking sheet. Season the salmon with ¼ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper.</li>
                            <li>Brush a generous amount of the prepared Frank's Red Hot sauce mixture over the salmon.</li>
                            <li>If using foil, you can create a loose tent over the salmon by bringing the sides of the foil up and crimping them together, or simply bake uncovered.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the salmon.</li>
                            <li>For a slightly caramelized glaze, you can switch the oven to broil for the last 1-2 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent the sauce from burning.</li>
                            <li>Serve immediately, with extra sauce if desired.</li>

                            <li>Bring the chili to a low boil. Then, reduce the heat to low or medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook uncovered for at least 20-25 minutes (or longer, up to several hours, for more flavor development), stirring occasionally.</li>
                            <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Let the chili rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld further. Serve with your favorite toppings (cheese, sour cream, onions, etc.).</li>

                            <li>400g/14 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
                            <li>3 thyme sprigs (or 1/2 tsp dried)</li>
                            <li>2 bay leaves (fresh or dried)</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt</li>
                            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
                            <li>1/4 tsp chilli flakes (red pepper flakes), optional</li>
                            <li>500g/1 lb pappardelle pasta (for serving)</li>
                            <li>Parmesan/Parmigiano Reggiano, finely grated (for serving)</li>
                            <li>Parsley, finely chopped (optional garnish)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C / 160°C fan-forced).</li>
                            <li><strong>Soffrito:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, grated carrot, grated celery, and fennel seeds. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and sweet, but not browned.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cook Sausage:</strong> Turn heat up to high. Add the sausage meat (removed from casings) to the pot. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's no longer pink. It doesn't need to brown deeply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deglaze:</strong> Add tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Pour in the red wine, bring to a simmer, and cook for 2 minutes, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, until the wine has reduced by about half.</li>
                            <li><strong>Slow Cook #1 (Oven):</strong> Add chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and chilli flakes (if using). Stir well. Bring to a simmer on the stovetop, then cover the pot with a lid and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook for 1 hour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Slow Cook #2 (Oven):</strong> Remove from oven. If desired, use a potato masher or sturdy spoon to break up the sausage meat further. Return to the oven, uncovered, for another 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the sauce has thickened and deepened in flavor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Season:</strong> Remove from oven. Remove bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Taste the sauce and add more salt if needed (sausages vary in saltiness).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cook Pasta:</strong> While the sauce is finishing its last 30 minutes in the oven, cook pappardelle pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Just before draining, reserve about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta.</li>
                            <li><strong>Toss with Sauce:</strong> Add the drained pasta directly to the pot with the bolognese sauce. Add a splash (about 1/2 cup) of the reserved pasta water. Toss everything together over low heat until the pasta is well-coated with the sauce and the sauce clings to the strands. Add more pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce to your desired consistency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately in warmed bowls, garnished generously with finely grated Parmesan or Parmigiano Reggiano and a pinch of finely chopped parsley, if desired.</li>

                            <li>1 lb lean ground beef (or turkey)</li>
                            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                            <li>1 cup diced tomatoes (canned or fresh, for filling)</li>
                            <li>1 packet taco seasoning (or make your own: chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper, paprika, oregano)</li>
                            <li>Water (as per taco seasoning instructions, usually 1/4 to 1/2 cup)</li>
                            <li>1.5 - 2 cups shredded cheese (e.g., Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Mexican blend), divided</li>
                            <li><strong>For Topping (Pico de Gallo style):</strong></li>
                            <li>1 cup additional diced tomatoes</li>
                            <li>2 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                            <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped (or red onion)</li>
                            <li>Optional: Lime juice</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                            <li>Place the prepared bell peppers (hollowed out) cut-side up in a baking dish. You can par-bake them for 10-15 minutes to soften them slightly, or stuff them raw (they will be more crisp-tender).</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Filling:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spatula, until browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes). Drain any excess fat.</li>
                            <li>Add minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds more until fragrant.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the taco seasoning and water (according to seasoning packet directions). Bring to a simmer and cook for a few minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in the cooked rice, corn, black beans, 1 cup diced tomatoes (for filling), and about 1 to 1.5 cups of the shredded cheese. Mix well to combine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stuff Peppers:</strong> Divide the meat and rice mixture evenly among the hollowed-out bell peppers, packing it in gently.</li>
                            <li>Top each stuffed pepper with the remaining shredded cheese.</li>
                            <li>Pour a little water (about 1/2 cup) into the bottom of the baking dish around the peppers (not into them) to help them steam.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes (if peppers were par-baked) or 30-40 minutes (if stuffed raw), until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Topping:</strong> While peppers are baking, combine the additional diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and finely chopped white/red onion in a small bowl. Add a squeeze of lime juice if desired.</li>
                            <li>Remove peppers from oven and let them rest for a few minutes. Top with the fresh tomato-onion-cilantro mixture before serving.</li>

                            <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Meatballs:</strong> In a large bowl, combine ground beef and ground pork. Break up any large lumps with your fingers.</li>
                            <li>Add finely chopped onion, minced garlic, bread crumbs, and egg. Mix gently but thoroughly.</li>
                            <li>Add milk and season well with salt and pepper. Mix again until just combined (do not overmix).</li>
                            <li>Roll the mixture into small, uniform-sized meatballs. Place on a clean plate, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours) to help them hold their shape.</li>
                            <li>Heat a dash of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Brown the meatballs on all sides, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan. They don't need to be cooked through at this stage.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the browned meatballs to an ovenproof dish. Cover and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) for about 20-30 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> While meatballs are baking (or after), melt 3 tbsp of butter in a clean pan or saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                            <li>Whisk in 3 tbsp of flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to make a roux.</li>
                            <li>Gradually whisk in the vegetable stock and beef stock, ensuring no lumps form. Continue whisking until the sauce begins to thicken.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the double cream (heavy cream), soy sauce, and Dijon mustard.</li>
                            <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook gently, stirring, until it has thickened to your desired consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
                            <li>Serve the meatballs hot, generously drizzled with the creamy sauce. Often served with mashed potatoes or egg noodles and lingonberry jam.</li>

                            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a large baking dish (e.g., 9x13 inch).</li>
                            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni 1-2 minutes less than package directions for al dente (it will finish cooking in the oven). Drain well.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cook Chorizo:</strong> In a large skillet or Dutch oven, cook the crumbled/diced chorizo over medium heat until browned and fat has rendered, about 5-7 minutes. Remove chorizo with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving about 1-2 tbsp of rendered fat in the skillet (discard excess). If chorizo didn't render much fat, add a little oil or butter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Roux:</strong> To the same skillet with chorizo fat (or added butter), add 3 tbsp of butter (if needed to make up 3 tbsp total fat). Melt over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and dry mustard powder. Cook, whisking constantly, for about 1-2 minutes until golden and bubbly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Cheese Sauce:</strong> Gradually whisk in the warmed milk and cream until smooth. Bring to a gentle simmer, whisking frequently, and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce begins to thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat. Add the shredded cheddar, gouda, and mozzarella cheeses to the sauce. Stir until all cheeses are melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combine:</strong> Add the cooked pasta and cooked chorizo to the cheese sauce. Stir gently to combine everything well.</li>
                            <li>Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. If desired, layer with a bit more cheese (optional). Top with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Topping:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine bread crumbs, melted butter, shredded parmesan cheese, paprika, and dried parsley. Mix well.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping evenly over the mac and cheese in the baking dish.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the mac and cheese is hot and bubbly.</li>

                            <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (or 1 tbsp cornstarch)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
                            <li><strong>For Egg Wash (optional):</strong></li>
                            <li>1 large egg, beaten with 1 tbsp water or milk</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Make the Pie Crust:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add cold, cubed butter. Cut in butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.</li>
                            <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing lightly with a fork after each addition, until dough just comes together. Be careful not to add too much water.</li>
                            <li>Divide dough in half, flatten each half into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Oven and Pie Plate:</strong> Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a large bowl, combine sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, 2 tbsp flour (for filling), cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss gently to coat evenly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assemble the Pie:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of chilled dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edges to leave about a 1-inch overhang.</li>
                            <li>Pour the apple filling into the crust-lined pie plate. Dot the top of the filling with the 2 tablespoons of butter pieces.</li>
                            <li>Roll out the second disc of dough into an 11 or 12-inch circle. Place over the filling. (Alternatively, cut into strips for a lattice top).</li>
                            <li>Trim the top crust edges to match the bottom crust overhang. Seal the edges by crimping them together with your fingers or a fork. Cut several vents in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
                            <li>If using, brush the top crust with the beaten egg wash.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bake the Pie:</strong> Bake at 400°F (200°C) for 20-25 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Continue baking for another 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. If the crust edges start to brown too quickly, cover them with foil or a pie shield.</li>
                            <li>Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours (preferably 4 hours) before slicing and serving. This allows the filling to set.</li>

                            <li>Divide dough in half, form each half into a disc, wrap in plastic, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 days).</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Filling:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of the blueberries, lime juice, lime zest, white sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes, until blueberries start to burst and release their juices.</li>
                            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 2 tbsp water until smooth. Stir this slurry into the berry mixture in the saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes more, until the mixture thickens and bubbles.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat. Gently stir in the remaining 3 cups of blueberries and the chopped fresh mint. Let the filling cool completely while you prepare the crusts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assemble Pie:</strong> Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place a large baking sheet on the middle rack to preheat (this helps create a crispy bottom crust).</li>
                            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of chilled dough into a 12-inch circle. Carefully transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Trim edges if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Pour the cooled blueberry mojito filling into the crust-lined pie plate.</li>
                            <li>Roll out the second disc of dough. Place it over the filling as a solid top crust (cut vents) or cut into strips for a lattice top. Trim, seal, and crimp the edges.</li>
                            <li>If desired, brush the top crust with beaten egg wash and sprinkle with Demerara sugar.</li>
                            <li>Place the pie in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to chill the crust thoroughly (helps prevent shrinking).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bake Pie:</strong> Place the chilled pie on the preheated baking sheet in the oven. Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for another 30-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the crust edges brown too quickly, cover them with foil or a pie shield.</li>
                            <li>Let the pie cool on a wire rack for at least 2-3 hours (preferably 4 hours) before cutting and serving, to allow the filling to set.</li>

                            <li><strong>For the Filling:</strong></li>
                            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                            <li>3 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
                            <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                            <li><strong>For the Cream Cheese Icing:</strong></li>
                            <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
                            <li>1½ cups powdered sugar (icing sugar), sifted</li>
                            <li>¼ cup (2 oz) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                            <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
                            <li>1/8 tsp salt (or a pinch)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Make Dough:</strong> In a large bowl (or bowl of a stand mixer), dissolve yeast in warm milk. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
                            <li>Add granulated sugar, melted butter, salt, and eggs to the yeast mixture. Whisk to combine.</li>
                            <li>Gradually add 4 cups of flour. If using a stand mixer, use the dough hook and mix on low speed until a soft dough forms. If mixing by hand, stir until combined, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
                            <li>Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes (by mixer or hand) until smooth and elastic. Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, only if the dough is too sticky to handle. Dough should be slightly tacky but pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                            <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with a clean, damp towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prepare Filling & Pan:</strong> While dough rises, combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Generously butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assemble Rolls:</strong> Punch down the risen dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle approximately 16x12 inches and about ¼ inch thick.</li>
                            <li>Spread the ⅓ cup softened butter evenly over the dough, leaving a small (½ inch) border along one long edge.</li>
                            <li>Sprinkle the brown sugar-cinnamon mixture evenly over the buttered dough.</li>
                            <li>Starting from one long edge (the one without the border), roll up the dough tightly into a log. Pinch the seam (the border edge) to seal.</li>
                            <li>Cut the log into 12 equal 1½-inch sections. A serrated knife or unflavored dental floss works well.</li>
                            <li>Place the rolls cut-side up in the prepared baking dish.</li>
                            <li><strong>Second Rise (Proofing):</strong> Cover the dish loosely with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let the rolls rise in a warm place for 30-45 minutes, or until nearly doubled in size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) during the last 15 minutes of proofing. Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make Icing:</strong> While rolls are baking (or cooling), beat softened butter, sifted powdered sugar, room temperature cream cheese, vanilla extract, and salt in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy.</li>
                            <li>Let the baked cinnamon rolls cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before spreading generously with the cream cheese icing. Serve warm.</li>

                            <li>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before carefully transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. They will be delicate when warm.</li>
